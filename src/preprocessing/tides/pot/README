You compile the program, then edit the .inp file according to your
needs. The name of the input file is set in the code. The lines in it:

name of the latlon ascii file
name of the first output file (8 constituents)
name of the second output file (just M2)
number of lat/lon points
a chunk of numbers
the names of the data files

Below that, all are ignored, leftovers of other grids.
